This example is for iCE40HX1K-EVB board 
www.olimex.com/wiki/iCE40HX1K-EVB
you need OLIMEXINO-32U4 set as programmer to program the board
---

This is for the EVB board still and works with the olimexino ice40 1k board.
Supports:
  - Flashing with buspirate using flashrom over SPI
  - icestormduino binary included with this repo over a secondary Arduino

Note, you do not need an Olimexino-32U4, but it helps, the UEXT cable makes it alot easier.
The ino sketch works with modifications for a standard Arduino and manual jumpwires between pins.
